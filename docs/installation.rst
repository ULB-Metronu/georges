Installation
============

No attempt is made to support python versions earlier than CPython 3.5. Jython and alternative implementation have not been tested.

The installation process to get Georges up and running is relatively simple:
the whole library is ready to be installed with `poetry`.

However, as the :mod:`georges` submodules (in particular the :mod:`georges.manzoni` tracking code) are optimized to work with the [Intel distribution for Python](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/using-intel-distribution-for-python-with-anaconda), detailed installation instructions are provided to install :mod: georges with Conda. This is the recommended way for the installation.

The Georges' git repository is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/ULB-Metronu/georges).

## Obtaining the Georges source code with Git

Simply clone the repository::

    git clone https://github.com/ULB-Metronu/georges

You can either stay on the bleeding-edge `master` branch or you can checkout a release tag::

    git checkout tags/2018.2

Dependencies
------------

A coherent set of dependencies is listed in the Conda `environment.txt` file as well as in the `setup.py` file (for `setuptools` and `pip`). In this way, installation using either `conda` or `pip` is possible. Note that the `pip` requirement file `requirements.txt` contains a single dot `.`, which refers to the dependency list provided in the `setup.py` file.

A typical user should not worry about those dependencies: they are properly managed either with `conda` (see next section) or with `pip` (see below).

Installation with Anaconda and the Intel Python Distribution libraries
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The installation procedure which follows creates a `conda` environment based on the Intel distribution for Python with all the necessary dependencies included and managed via `conda` itself (this ensures that all the dependencies are, if possible, based on the Intel channel and not managed with `pip`). Georges is then installed using `pip` from that `conda` environment. The dependencies are coherent and the `pip` installation of Georges will find all the dependencies listed in `setup.py` to be already installed in the `conda` environment.

1. Install [Conda](https://conda.io/docs/) for your operating system, follow the instructions for
* [Linux](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/linux.html)
* [macOS](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/macos.html)
* [Windows](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/windows.html)

2. Obtain a copy of the git repository (see previous section)

3. Create a dedicated `conda` environment (default name is `ipy3` for Intel Python 3)::

        cd path/to/georges
        conda env create -f environment.yml

4. Activate the environment::

        conda activate ipy3

5. Install Georges using `pip` from the `conda` environment::

        # Typical installation
        pip install . 

        # Install with pip in editable mode to get access to the modifications on the git repository
        pip install -e .
        
Georges can be subsequently updated by running::

    cd path/to/georges
    git pull origin master
    pip install --upgrade georges


Installation with pip
---------------------

In case Georges needs to be installed with the system Python or a Python installation that is not managed with `conda`, the following simple steps can be followed to use `pip` directly. All the dependencies are then managed with `pip`. Please note that this will typically not enable the Intel optimization, resulting in slower code execution for the :mod: manzoni module.

1. Obtain a copy of the git repository (see previous section)

2. Install Georges with `pip`::

        # Typical installation
        pip install . 

        # Install with pip in editable mode to get access to the modifications on the git repository
        pip install -e .

Georges can be subsequently updated by running::

    cd path/to/georges
    git pull origin master
    pip install --upgrade georges


Using Georges with Jupyter Notebook
-----------------------------------

Georges can be used with Jupyter notebooks. No special care is needed.

If you installed Georges within the `conda` environment, simply run (note that it is not advised to put all your notebook within the `git` structure)::

    cd somewhere/good/for/notebooks
    jupyter notebook


Georges distribution with Docker
--------------------------------

`TODO`

A Docker image is made available to provide an easy access to a complete Jupyter Notebook + madx + georges environment.
 
Use  the *Dockerfile* to build the image::

    docker build .

or, to register the image as well::


    docker build -t username/georges .

You can run a container with::

    docker run -it username/georges

then connect to [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888) to access the Jupyter Notebook interface.

The image includes a complete Anaconda Python3 environment with the most common packages. 
The latest *MAD-X* development release is available in */usr/local/bin/madx*.
