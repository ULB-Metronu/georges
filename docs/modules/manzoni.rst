The Manzoni module aims to implement fast particle beam tracking through the most encountered accelerator
and beamline elements (magnets, scatterers and degraders, collimators and cavities).
The module is structured as follows:

* :ref:`elements`
* :ref:`apertures`
* :ref:`beam`
* :ref:`input`
* :ref:`core`
* :ref:`integrators`
* :ref:`kernels`
* :ref:`maps`
* :ref:`observers`
