Elements
########

The `elements` submodule contains the physical implementation of the different beamline elements,
namely:

- Drifts, dipoles, quadrupoles, sextupoles and multipoles (magnets with a combined dipolar, quadrupolar and sextupolar function),
- Collimators (rectangular, circular and elliptical);
- Scatterers (thin materials that interact with the particles and only modify the transverse angle along the two transverse axes);
- Degraders (thick materials which combine particle interaction with a simple drift type propagation along the material);
